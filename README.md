# Plausible Uncertainties
This repo contains methods used in the paper ["Plausible Uncertainties for Human Pose Regression"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Bramlage_Plausible_Uncertainties_for_Human_Pose_Regression_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf) published at ICCV 2023. These methods have been adapted from prior work where noted in the code. They also include our own interpretation of multivariate deep evidential regression.
